How to install:

1. Download WA Editor 0.96 from : http://www.midnightsynergy.com/adventures/editor/wa_editor096.exe
2. After installation, replace files.
3. Use the readme from the latest release, to read what's up.

NOTE: You can have the editor without any installations and replacements, and launch it directly from the github release folder, but I don't recommend it unless you know what you're doing.

The old repository is now discontinued, and all editor/player-engine changes will happen here.
